# COMPSCI 230 : Object Oriented Software Development

## Course Overview

An introduction to object-oriented paradigm of designing and developing software applications. The focus of this course would be on learning good software design objectives and principles. Using Java programming language, students will learn modelling and developing software applications of reasonable complexity and quality through the application of established object-oriented design principles and patterns. In doing so, students will also demonstrate fundamental skills in object-oriented software development, GUI programming and application-level multi-threading.
This course is one of the prerequisites for the third year courses of COMPSCI 331, COMPSCI 335, COMPSCI 340, COMPSCI 345 and COMPSCI 373. The skills developed in this course are particularly useful for those wishing to have a career in professional software development. Students planning to take the capstone course next year are also expected to benefit from the learning outcomes of this course.
